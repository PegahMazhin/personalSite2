                    <img src="./images/guitar.webp"/>
                    <p> I started playing guitar at age 13. I started with acccoustic guitar. Recently I purchased an electric guitar
                        and I have been practicing that. I love playing guitar because it is one way to get in touch with your feelings.

                    <p> I like cats and I have one of them. They are warm, fluffy and have their own personality. I love it when my cat sit next to me while I'm doing my own work.
                        I love it when I see my cat is playing. That makes me happy.
